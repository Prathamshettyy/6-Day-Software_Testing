6-Day Software Testing Course: Assignment Submission
This repository, 6-Day Software Testing, is the assignment submission for a 6-day software testing course. It documents the lessons taught and activities completed during the course, with each day's work summarized in a dedicated README file within the Day_1 to Day_6 folders. The course covered essential software testing concepts, tools, and techniques, culminating in a final project that applied both manual and automated testing skills.
Course Overview
The 6-day software testing course provided a comprehensive introduction to software quality assurance. Through lectures, hands-on exercises, and assignments, participants learned to design and execute tests, use industry-standard tools, and apply testing in real-world scenarios. This repository captures the key topics covered and deliverables produced each day, as required for the course assignment.
Assignment Objectives

Document the core concepts and tools taught in the course.
Showcase practical exercises and deliverables completed each day.
Demonstrate proficiency in manual and automated testing techniques.
Present a final project integrating skills learned throughout the course.

Repository Structure
The repository is organized into six folders, one for each day of the course. Each folder contains a README.md file summarizing:

What was taught: Topics, concepts, or tools introduced.
What was done: Exercises, assignments, or deliverables completed.
