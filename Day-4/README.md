### 🌐 **Deploying Websites with Render**

Day 4 of the Skill Lab provided an incredibly practical learning experience, focusing on two critical aspects of modern development: **web deployment** and **version control with Git**. These tools are fundamental for bringing projects to life and collaborating effectively in real-world software environments.

A major highlight of the session was learning how to deploy a web project using **Render**, a user-friendly cloud hosting platform. Guided by our instructor, I successfully:

- Prepared my portfolio website for deployment  
- Set up a web service on Render  
- Connected my local project to the platform  
- Published it with a live, shareable URL

This hands-on experience gave me a clear understanding of the **deployment lifecycle**—from local development to hosting a publicly accessible application. It reinforced the importance of showcasing projects online in a professional manner.

### 🧰 **Mastering Git & Version Control**

The second half of the session introduced us to **Git**, a widely-used version control system that helps manage and track changes in code. During this activity, I learned how to:

- Clone repositories from **GitHub** to my local environment  
- Fork existing repositories for independent development  
- Push updates to remote repositories  
- Use key commands to manage and organize code versions

These skills are indispensable in **collaborative software development**, **open-source contributions**, and maintaining personal projects efficiently and securely.
