📘 Skill Lab – Day 5 Report
🔍 API Testing, CSS Selectors & Web Automation

Day 5 of the Skill Lab was an engaging and insightful session that introduced me to three essential components of modern web development: API testing, CSS selectors, and web automation. Through hands-on tasks and guided instruction, I gained a deeper appreciation for how developers ensure functionality, accuracy, and reliability in web applications.

🌐 REST APIs & Practical Testing

We kicked off the day with a solid introduction to RESTful APIs—a core part of how frontends and backends communicate. I learned the structure of HTTP requests and how APIs handle data exchange. During the session, I had the opportunity to:

Perform real-time API requests from my local machine

Test API endpoints using tools like Postman

Work with authentication headers and various parameters

Interpret and debug API responses to identify issues

This gave me a clearer understanding of how APIs operate under the hood and how they are tested and validated in real-world scenarios.

🎯 CSS Selectors & DOM Access

The next focus area was mastering CSS selectors, which are critical not just for styling but also for targeting DOM elements during scripting and automation. I explored various selector types and learned how they are applied to:

Style specific components accurately

Access elements dynamically in the DOM

Enhance automation scripts using tools like Selenium

Practicing selectors helped reinforce my understanding of webpage structures and how precision impacts functionality.

🤖 Web Automation with Selenium

In the final part of the session, I was introduced to Selenium, a powerful tool used for browser automation and UI testing. I practiced:

Writing simple Selenium scripts for automation

Using CSS selectors to locate elements on a page

Automating tasks like form filling, button clicks, and navigation

Simulating real-user interactions for testing web applications

This activity showed how automation can speed up repetitive testing tasks and improve software reliability during development cycles.

💡 Key Takeaways

Gained hands-on experience with API testing using Postman

Learned how to handle requests, responses, and authentication in APIs

Practiced advanced CSS selectors for precise DOM targeting

Automated browser interactions with basic Selenium scripts

Understood the role of automation in development and quality assurance

🎯 Session Outcome

By the end of Day 5, I was equipped with the skills to test APIs effectively, interact with the DOM using CSS selectors, and automate web-based tasks using Selenium. These competencies are invaluable for both full-stack development and QA processes, and this session significantly strengthened my foundation in both areas.
