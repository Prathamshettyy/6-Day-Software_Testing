### üåê **REST APIs & Practical Testing**

Day 5 of the Skill Lab was an engaging and insightful session that introduced me to three essential components of modern web development: **API testing**, **CSS selectors**, and **web automation**. Through hands-on tasks and guided instruction, I gained a deeper appreciation for how developers ensure functionality, accuracy, and reliability in web applications.

We kicked off the day with a solid introduction to **RESTful APIs**‚Äîa core part of how frontends and backends communicate. I learned the structure of **HTTP requests** and how APIs handle data exchange. During the session, I had the opportunity to:

- Perform real-time API requests from my local machine  
- Test API endpoints using tools like **Postman**  
- Work with **authentication headers** and various parameters  
- Interpret and debug **API responses** to identify issues  

This gave me a clearer understanding of how APIs operate under the hood and how they are tested and validated in real-world scenarios.

### üéØ **CSS Selectors & DOM Access**

The next focus area was mastering **CSS selectors**, which are critical not just for styling but also for targeting DOM elements during scripting and automation. I explored various selector types and learned how they are applied to:

- Style specific components accurately  
- Access elements dynamically in the **DOM**  
- Enhance automation scripts using tools like **Selenium**

Practicing selectors helped reinforce my understanding of **webpage structures** and how precision impacts functionality.

### ü§ñ **Web Automation with Selenium**

In the final part of the session, I was introduced to **Selenium**, a powerful tool used for **browser automation** and **UI testing**. I practiced:

- Writing simple **Selenium scripts** for automation  
- Using **CSS selectors** to locate elements on a page  
- Automating tasks like **form filling, button clicks**, and **navigation**  
- Simulating real-user interactions for testing web applications  

This activity showed how **automation** can speed up **repetitive testing tasks** and improve **software reliability** during development cycles.

### üí° **Key Takeaways**

- Gained hands-on experience with **API testing** using **Postman**  
- Learned how to handle **requests, responses, and authentication** in APIs  
- Practiced advanced **CSS selectors** for precise DOM targeting  
- Automated browser interactions with basic **Selenium scripts**  
- Understood the role of **automation** in development and quality assurance

### üéØ **Session Outcome**

By the end of Day 5, I was equipped with the skills to **test APIs effectively**, interact with the **DOM using CSS selectors**, and **automate web-based tasks** using **Selenium**. These competencies are invaluable for both **full-stack development** and **QA processes**, and this session significantly strengthened my foundation in both areas.
